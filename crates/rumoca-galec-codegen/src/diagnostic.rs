//! SPEC_0008-shaped diagnostics for the DAE → GALEC projection.
//!
//! Error codes use the stable `ET0xx` range (GALEC **T**arget projection).
//! Variants carry the best available source [`Span`] from the canonical DAE
//! (variable declaration spans, clock expression spans, function declaration
//! spans); constructs without a source anchor report no span rather than a
//! fabricated one.
//!
//! Per SPEC_0034 GAL-025, rejections that reflect the current scope of the
//! Rumoca projection (continuous states, external functions, runtime events)
//! say "not yet supported by the Rumoca GALEC projection" — never
//! "unsupported by eFMI", because eFMI itself expects discretized models.
