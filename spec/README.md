# Rumoca Specification Index

Contributor-facing workflow commands referenced by the active specs are standardized through the
`rum` developer CLI. The main groups are:

- `cargo xtask verify ...`
- `cargo xtask coverage ...`
- `cargo xtask repo ...`

For setup and day-to-day usage, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Deferred Specifications

Deferred specs are non-active future-work proposals. They do not gate reviews or
CI, but remain worth preserving because the design direction is likely to be
useful after the 0.9 stabilization work.
